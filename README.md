# ðŸ“ˆ Linear Regression from Scratch using NumPy

This project demonstrates a complete **implementation of Linear Regression** from scratch using only **NumPy** and **Matplotlib** â€” no machine learning libraries like Scikit-learn.  
It includes a manual training loop, visual animation of the regression line as it learns, and basic experimentation on sample data.

---

## ðŸš€ Features

- Linear Regression model trained with **Gradient Descent**
- Calculates predictions using the learned parameters
- Uses **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** as the loss function
- Updates weights (`m`) and bias (`c`) using backpropagation
- Visualizes how the regression line improves during training using **matplotlib.animation**
- Saves the animation as a `.gif` file

## ðŸ§  Concepts Covered

- Linear prediction: \( y = mx + c \)
- Mean Squared Error loss:  
  \[
  \text{MSE} = \frac{1}{n} \sum (y_{\text{true}} - y_{\text{pred}})^2
  \]
- Gradient Descent for minimizing loss
- Visualization of model learning process
